# ........Description......

For the structure given in Listing 11, create an array of structure with 100 elements. In the
program, assign them random values and then read all the values to display on the console. Do
not align any of the structure fields and the structure variables itself.
Repeat the experiment, but with properly aligned variables and structure fields. For both
the programs, measure the total run time.
Implement a modular design by dividing the work into various procedures.
